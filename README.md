# SQL Assignment

## 1) What is SQL? Why is it called a DSL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to store, retrieve, and manage data in relational databases.  
It is known for its simplicity and powerful capabilities in handling structured data.  
SQL is called a **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** because it is designed specifically for database operations, unlike general-purpose languages like Python or Java.

## 2) Types of Languages: Declarative and Functional

**Declarative languages** describe *what* the program should accomplish without specifying how to do it. SQL is an exampleâ€”it tells the database *what* data is needed.  
**Functional languages** (like Haskell or Scala) are based on mathematical functions. They emphasize immutability, no side effects, and function composition to solve problems.
